# Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining Homework 1
This repository contains everything that needs to be delivered for the first homework assignment of the ADM course.
## Files description
1.  __`scripts.ipynb`__: This Jupyter notebook contains all the challenges requested in the Homework 1. The file is organized as follows:
- 1 markdown cell (header 1) specifying the exercise number (i.e., **Problem 1**, **Problem 2**);
- 1 markdown cell (header 2) specifying the problem section (e.g., **Data Types**, **Regex and Parsing**, etc.);
- 1 markdown cell (header 4) specifying the problem name (e.g., **Finding the percentage**, **Validating phone numbers**, etc.);
- 1 code cell containing the code for the mentioned problem.
2. __`stamps/`__: This folder contains all the screenshot that assess the successful exercises I did (in my case, every exercise requested). There are two subfolders:
    1. __`Problem 1/`__: This folder contains 13 screenshots, each one named after one single section (e.g., `02_Data Types`, `10_Regex and Parsing`, etc.) and containing the prove that these problems have been correctly solved.
    2. __`Problem 2/`__: This folder contains 6 screenshot, each one named after one single algorithm of the second problem (e.g., `4_Recursive Digit Sum`) and containing the prove that this specific algorithm challenge has been correctly solved.
